# code as UI via extensive  syntax, texture, formatting and emojis
- comment colorizer
- emojis usage

# ⌨️ UHK workaround and kludges
- wanted to achieve parity between MBP built-in keyboard setup as configured in Karabiner Elements... and UHK keyboard affected by UHK's programming in UHK Agent at hardware level. things like split space bar
## split spacebar and  Rctrl-mode
see my [EN note](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s107/sh/2ce02da7-2bc5-4ac7-a64b-27bc3483386d/LPknInhkjXOx9qTJ420zsgqsWAbbIowAuQaF1wGzfzrmHmELs8kuunM2vg)
- had to come up with workaround to deal with UHK split spacebar
  - if both keys assigned to space, lost exstensibility, e.g.

## FN fn key
- affects BTT FN+⌘/⇧ to move/resize window
see my EN [Note](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s107/sh/de794a31-e047-4a51-a6fb-abefb38187ff/ZfYX8IKWXy3wpA-NUDR2WavpyZLbg8GMabBIh2FAh1rptJFJkWW9BGQNug)

# Window mgmt via Contexts and FN key
- TAB and SEMICOLONG configured in KE to send FN on hold -> Contexts set to activate "quick search" when fn pressed
# BTT window manipulation
- BTT set to manipulate windows
  - FN+COMMAND to resize
  - FN+SHIFT to move

# Special Modes
## NUMPAD MODE (and symbole mode)
### usage:
- l_control+r_control (must release l_control) to turn uiojklm (key grid naturally under right hand) into symbols
- r_control+l_control (must release r_control) to turn uiojklm,. into numpad
- see [notes](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s107/sh/c329bb2e-889b-4ad7-976f-0102d40ab18c/SrDoX2KMlevKrvlk5x3Yfh_AXLZldRWXyDiHvacdKxtKO9-q0upTtb7fQg)

## MOUSEPAD MODE
see [EN note](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s107/sh/8e0408df-3768-4f30-9fcf-76cd203d27ad/0ey5Lv0g5KdROc8Gh8Q9EwSkcNa37lKSbRq3oHXxDJu9SEL4QjGbHGheCA)

## REMOTE MODE
goal: be able to control applications in background with out losing focus (reduce context switching)... by sending
- for example, sending common transport controls (like play/pause/scrub/speed up) to media players (spotify, YouTube...)

# OTHER
## Micros
## Hover system
## long hold, double presses
## g+spacebar for GUI click

# 🔉 audio feedback
- way to differentiate between events happening at different levels/stages in a chain... or determine if triggered at all
  - sounds at KE layer (bubbles)
  - sounds at KM layer...
  - sounds at BTT layer
- signals when macro is triggered, hits a milestone, or finishes...
- sounds really cool
